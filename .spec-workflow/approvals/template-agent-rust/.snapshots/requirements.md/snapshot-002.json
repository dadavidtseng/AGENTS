  "content": "# Requirements Document: Template Agent Rust\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document specifies requirements for creating a Rust-based agent template (template-agent-rust) that mirrors the functionality of the existing template-agent-typescript while leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and concurrency features. The template will serve as a production-ready foundation for building intelligent agents within the KĀDI (Knowledge Agent Development Infrastructure) ecosystem.\n\n**Purpose**: Provide developers with a high-performance, type-safe alternative to the TypeScript template for building KĀDI agents in Rust.\n\n**Value**:\n- Performance-critical agent deployments with lower memory footprint\n- Enhanced type safety and compile-time guarantees\n- Better concurrency handling for high-throughput scenarios\n- Zero-cost abstractions and predictable performance\n- Memory safety without garbage collection overhead\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis Rust template aligns with KĀDI's vision of providing multi-language agent development infrastructure by:\n- **Multi-language Support**: Expanding template ecosystem beyond TypeScript/JavaScript\n- **Performance Options**: Enabling developers to choose between development speed (TypeScript) and runtime performance (Rust)\n- **Protocol Compatibility**: Maintaining full KĀDI protocol compliance for seamless inter-agent communication\n- **Production Readiness**: Providing enterprise-grade templates with comprehensive features out-of-the-box\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Multi-LLM Provider System\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate multiple LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI-compatible Model Manager) with automatic fallback, so that my agent can reliably generate intelligent responses even when individual providers fail.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the agent initializes THEN the system SHALL load provider configurations from environment variables\n2. WHEN a user message specifies a model using bracket notation (e.g., `[claude-3-5-sonnet]`) THEN the system SHALL route to the appropriate provider\n3. WHEN a primary provider request fails THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with the fallback provider\n4. WHEN no model is specified THEN the system SHALL use the configured default provider\n5. IF a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log warnings and continue with available providers\n6. WHEN making provider requests THEN the system SHALL return Result&lt;T, E&gt; types for predictable error handling\n7. WHEN streaming responses THEN the system SHALL support async streaming via Rust's async/await\n\n### Requirement 2: Hybrid Memory System\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a hybrid memory system combining fast JSON file storage with persistent database storage, so that my agent can maintain conversation context efficiently while archiving historical data.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a message is stored THEN the system SHALL write to JSON files synchronously for immediate availability\n2. WHEN a conversation exceeds 20 messages THEN the system SHALL automatically archive oldest 10 messages to database\n3. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to file-only mode without crashing\n4. WHEN retrieving context THEN the system SHALL load last N messages from JSON files in O(1) time\n5. WHEN searching long-term history THEN the system SHALL query the database with relevance scoring\n6. WHEN storing user preferences THEN the system SHALL persist to dedicated JSON files per user\n7. IF file I/O operations fail THEN the system SHALL return descriptive errors via Result&lt;T, E&gt;\n\n### Requirement 3: File Management Capabilities\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive file management capabilities (local file server, cloud storage, container registry, SSH/SCP), so that my agent can handle diverse file operation requirements via KĀDI protocol.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN starting a file server THEN the system SHALL expose local directory via HTTP and establish public tunnel\n2. WHEN uploading to cloud storage THEN the system SHALL support AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure providers\n3. WHEN sharing Docker containers THEN the system SHALL create temporary registry with authentication\n4. WHEN performing SSH operations THEN the system SHALL execute remote commands and transfer files securely\n5. IF any file operation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed error information without panicking\n6. WHEN multiple file operations execute concurrently THEN the system SHALL handle them safely using Rust's ownership model\n\n### Requirement 4: Autonomous Deployment System\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want programmatic deployment to Digital Ocean infrastructure, so that my agent can self-deploy Model Manager Gateway and configure itself autonomously.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN deploying Model Manager THEN the system SHALL create Digital Ocean droplets via API\n2. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL return gateway URL, API keys, and registered models\n3. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL cleanup resources and return detailed error\n4. WHEN generating API keys THEN the system SHALL communicate with gateway admin endpoints\n5. WHEN registering models THEN the system SHALL configure OpenAI-compatible model providers\n\n### Requirement 5: Bot Integration (Slack & Discord)\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want event-driven bot implementations for Slack and Discord, so that my agent can participate in team conversations with persistent memory.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a bot receives @mention event via KĀDI THEN it SHALL retrieve conversation context from memory\n2. WHEN generating bot response THEN it SHALL use the configured LLM provider with conversation history\n3. WHEN bot responds THEN it SHALL store the conversation turn in memory system\n4. IF bot response fails THEN it SHALL retry with exponential backoff up to 3 times\n5. WHEN circuit breaker opens THEN the system SHALL prevent cascading failures\n6. WHEN users specify model preference THEN the bot SHALL honor `[model-name]` syntax\n\n### Requirement 6: KĀDI Protocol Integration\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want full KĀDI protocol support for tool registration, discovery, and invocation, so that my Rust agent can interoperate with agents written in other languages.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN agent starts THEN it SHALL register tools with KĀDI broker via WebSocket\n2. WHEN tool invocation arrives THEN it SHALL deserialize request, execute tool, and return result\n3. WHEN publishing events THEN it SHALL use KĀDI event bus for asynchronous communication\n4. IF broker connection drops THEN it SHALL reconnect automatically with exponential backoff\n5. WHEN subscribing to events THEN it SHALL process incoming events asynchronously\n\n### Requirement 7: Configuration & Environment Management\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive environment-based configuration, so that I can deploy the agent across different environments without code changes.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN agent starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from `.env` file\n2. WHEN required variables are missing THEN it SHALL fail fast with clear error messages\n3. IF optional variables are absent THEN it SHALL use sensible defaults\n4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate before applying\n\n### Requirement 8: Error Handling & Observability\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can diagnose issues in production environments.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use Result&lt;T, E&gt; pattern (never panic in library code)\n2. WHEN logging events THEN it SHALL use structured logging with log levels\n3. WHEN operations timeout THEN it SHALL return TimeoutError with context\n4. IF provider rate limits trigger THEN it SHALL return RateLimitError with retry-after\n5. WHEN fatal errors occur in main THEN it MAY panic with clear error message\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module (provider, memory, deployment, bot) has one clear responsibility\n- **Modular Design**: Crates organized as library (`lib.rs`) with multiple sub-modules\n- **Dependency Management**: Use `Cargo.toml` workspace for shared dependencies\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define trait boundaries for providers, storage adapters, and delivery mechanisms\n- **Error Types**: Custom error enums per module using `thiserror` crate\n- **Async Runtime**: Use Tokio for async/await with proper task spawning\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: JSON parsing with `serde_json` (streaming where possible)\n- **Concurrency**: Leverage Tokio async runtime for concurrent I/O operations\n- **Zero-Copy**: Use `Bytes` for network buffers to minimize allocations\n- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP clients and database connections\n- **Startup Time**: Agent should initialize within 2 seconds\n- **Response Latency**: 95th percentile < 500ms for tool invocations (excluding LLM calls)\n\n### Security\n\n- **API Key Management**: Load secrets from environment variables, never hardcode\n- **TLS/SSL**: Use rustls for encrypted connections (no OpenSSL dependency)\n- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs using Serde validation\n- **Error Messages**: Never expose internal paths or sensitive data in error messages\n- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits via `cargo audit`\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue operating when subsystems fail (e.g., database unavailable)\n- **Automatic Reconnection**: Retry WebSocket connections with exponential backoff\n- **Resource Cleanup**: Implement Drop trait for proper resource cleanup\n- **Panic Safety**: Library code MUST NOT panic (use Result&lt;T, E&gt;)\n- **Health Checks**: Provide health check endpoints for monitoring\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc comments for all public APIs\n- **Examples**: Working examples in `examples/` directory\n- **Quick Start**: Developer can run agent within 5 minutes of cloning\n- **Error Messages**: Actionable error messages with troubleshooting hints\n- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system to make invalid states unrepresentable\n\n### Build & Development\n\n- **Build Time**: Full release build < 3 minutes on modern hardware\n- **Testing**: Unit tests for core logic, integration tests for flows\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for testing and linting\n- **Code Quality**: Enforce `clippy` lints and `rustfmt` formatting\n- **Cross-Platform**: Support Linux, macOS, Windows\n",
