Overview\r\n\r\n### 1.1 Purpose\r\n\r\nEnable **agent-producer** to act as an intelligent orchestrator that:\r\n- Receives user requests from multiple channels (Slack, Discord, Claude Code, Claude Desktop)\r\n- Breaks down work into structured tasks using **mcp-shrimp-task-manager** (accessed via KĀDI broker)\r\n- Publishes task assignment events via KĀDI broker for worker agents to subscribe\r\n- **Monitors execution via event subscription** (workers publish completion events)\r\n- Coordinates with **shadow agents** that track and version every file operation\r\n- Coordinates user verification and GitHub push\r\n- Notifies worker agents to cleanup worktrees after successful completion\r\n\r\n### 1.2 Background\r\n\r\nCurrent multi-agent systems lack centralized orchestration with real-time monitoring and versioning. This specification introduces a comprehensive orchestration pattern that leverages:\r\n\r\n- **mcp-shrimp-task-manager** (located at `C:\\GitHub\\mcp-shrimp-task-manager`) for centralized task/spec management\r\n- **KĀDI broker** for event-driven agent communication\r\n- **Multi-channel support** via Slack/Discord (event-driven via mcp-client-slack/discord) and Claude Code/Claude Desktop (tool-based via agent-producer MCP tools)\r\n- **Shadow agents** for continuous file operation monitoring and versioning\r\n- **Event-based status tracking** (no polling required)\r\n\r\n### 1.3 Goals\r\n\r\n- **G1:** Automate project decomposition from user requirements to executable tasks\r\n- **G2:** Enable concurrent task execution with git worktree workspace isolation (managed by **worker agents**)\r\n- **G3:** Distribute tasks via **KĀDI event publishing** (agents.*.tasks.assign)\r\n- **G4:** Monitor execution via **event subscription** (agents.*.tasks.completed)\r\n- **G5:** Version every file operation via **shadow agents** with separate remote repositories (enables rollback when agents make mistakes or user disagrees; allows worker agents to work uninterrupted)\r\n- **G6:** Ensure quality through systematic verification before user review\r\n- **G7:** Handle failures gracefully with automatic reassignment\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. User Stories\r\n\r\n### Epic 1: Request Processing\r\n\r\n**US-1.1:** As a **user**, I want to **submit feature requests via Slack, Discord, Claude Code, or Claude Desktop**, so that **I can use my preferred interface**.\r\n\r\n- **EARS Criteria:**\r\n  - **WHEN** user sends message via Slack or Discord: \"Can you create a design document to make a cube spinning randomly and changes color gradually?\"\r\n  - **THEN** agent-producer receives event through kadi-broker from mcp-client-slack or mcp-client-discord\r\n  - **AND** acknowledges receipt within 2 seconds\r\n  - **WHEN** user calls `plan_task` tool via Claude Code or Claude Desktop\r\n  - **THEN** agent-producer receives tool invocation through kadi-broker\r\n  - **AND** starts task planning workflow\r\n\r\n**US-1.2:** As a **user**, I want to **receive immediate acknowledgment of my request**, so that **I know the system is processing it**.\r\n\r\n- **EARS Criteria:**\r\n  - **WHEN** agent-producer receives user request\r\n  - **THEN** responds with acknowledgment message in same channel\r\n  - **AND** includes estimated planning time\r\n  - **Example:** \"Got it!

Security Considerations\r\n\r\n### SEC-1: Git Worktree Isolation\r\n\r\n- Each worker agent operates in isolated worktree\r\n- No file system conflicts between agents\r\n- Failed tasks preserve worktree for debugging\r\n\r\n### SEC-2: Shadow Repository Access\r\n\r\n- Shadow agents require separate remote repository credentials\r\n- Shadow repos have read-only access for non-shadow agents\r\n- Shadow commits signed with shadow agent identity\r\n\r\n### SEC-3: Event Authentication\r\n\r\n- All events published through authenticated KĀDI broker\r\n- Event source verified via broker authentication\r\n- Shadow agents verify file operation events match expected worker\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 9. Testing Strategy\r\n\r\n### Test Scenarios\r\n\r\n**TS-1: End-to-End Task Orchestration**\r\n1. User submits request via Slack\r\n2. agent-producer creates spec and tasks\r\n3. Tasks assigned to worker agents via events\r\n4. Workers create own worktrees\r\n5. Workers execute tasks and publish file events\r\n6. Shadow agents commit every file operation\r\n7. Workers publish completion events\r\n8. agent-producer requests user verification\r\n9. User approves\r\n10. agent-producer pushes from base playground\r\n11. Workers cleanup their worktrees\r\n\r\n**TS-2: Shadow Agent Versioning**\r\n1. Worker creates file → Shadow commits + pushes\r\n2. Worker modifies file → Shadow commits + pushes\r\n3. Worker removes file → Shadow commits + pushes\r\n4. Worker moves file → Shadow commits + pushes\r\n5. Verify shadow repo has complete history\r\n\r\n**TS-3: Event-Based Monitoring**\r\n1. Worker completes task → Publishes completion event\r\n2. agent-producer receives event (NO polling)\r\n3. Verify latency < 1 second\r\n\r\n**TS-4: Failure Recovery**\r\n1. Worker task fails → Publishes failure event\r\n2. Worker preserves worktree\r\n3. agent-producer notifies user\r\n4. User can inspect worktree for debugging\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 10. Acceptance Criteria\r\n\r\n**AC-1:** agent-producer MUST use event subscription (NOT polling) for task monitoring\r\n**AC-2:** Worker agents MUST create and manage their OWN git worktrees\r\n**AC-3:** Shadow agents MUST commit and push EVERY file operation to separate remote repos\r\n**AC-4:** agent-producer MUST push from base playground directory (NOT from worktrees)\r\n**AC-5:** Network names MUST be: artist, design, programmer (NOT development)\r\n**AC-6:** MCP server path MUST be: C:\\GitHub\\mcp-shrimp-task-manager\r\n**AC-7:** User verification MUST occur before git push\r\n**AC-8:** Worker agents MUST publish file operation events for shadow monitoring\r\n**AC-9:** Shadow agents MUST have dedicated remote repositories\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 11. Dependencies\r\n\r\n- **mcp-shrimp-task-manager** at `C:\\GitHub\\mcp-shrimp-task-manager`\r\n- **mcp-server-git** for worktree and push operations\r\n- **mcp-client-slack** for Slack event listening\r\n- **mcp-client-discord** for Discord event listening\r\n- **KĀDI broker** for event-driven communication\r\n- **agent-producer** with existing slack-bot.ts and discord-bot.ts\r\n- **@agents/shared** BaseBot for worker and shadow agents\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 12. Open Questions\r\n\r\n1. What are the GitHub repository URLs for the three shadow remote repos?\r\n2. Should shadow agents require separate credentials or share with main repo?\r\n3. What is the retention policy for shadow repositories (how long to keep history)?\r\n4. Should there be a maximum file operation rate to prevent shadow agent overload?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**END OF REQUIREMENTS**\r\n",
